# Neuronal oscillations on evolving networks: Dynamics, Damage, Degeneration, Decline, Dementia and Death: A review and extension of Goreily et al. (2020)

## Overview
This project extends the work of Goreily et al. (2020) on neuronal oscillations in evolving networks, focusing on the dynamics of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. We explore the progression of neural network degeneration through computational modeling and analysis of resting-state brain dynamics.

## Key Features
1. **Neurodegenerative Disease Modeling**: Implementation of Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov and Heterodimer models for protein spread in evolving brain networks.
2. **Resting-State Brain Dynamics Analysis**: Application of signal processing techniques to analyze cognitive decline over time, including dynamic biomarkers like Gamma range power and metastability index.
3. **Hemispheric Differences and Homeostasis**: Investigation of inter-hemispheric variations in disease progression and the impact of network homeostasis on cognitive decline using Graph Laplacian methods and homeostatic adaptation models.

## Results
Our extended model provides insights into:
- The progression of neurodegenerative diseases in brain networks
- The relationship between structural network changes and neural dynamics
- The role of hemispheric differences and homeostasis in cognitive decline
